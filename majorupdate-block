Major Updating has been blocked for this current moment in time due to a combination of both a massive issue with EVERY 16.04 > 18.04 upgrade path, which was caused by an update to the MESA package (a backport) causing the version number of MESA in 16.04 to be higher than the version in 18.04, causing DPKG to keep the 16.04 version, creating massive dependency issues that can completely trash the graphical pieces of the Feren OS Installation, including DEs, System Libraries, and so on, but has since been fixed, as well as a poll I made about unblocking the upgrade path before Ubuntu 18.04.1's release getting trumendous outcry for keeping the path blocked until Ubuntu 18.04.1's release.
As a result of this, I'm keeping this blocked until Ubuntu 18.04.1 gets released, as 18.04.1 is when Canonical then releases their own upgrade path from 16.04 to 18.04, therefore meaning that the upgrade path issues would then affect Ubuntu users too, prompting faster bug fixing. I'm sorry for the inconveinience caused by this, the people's thoughts are what cares the most (over 100 people voted in the poll), and Ubuntu 18.04.1's just around the corner, as well, just wait a little bit more, you'll be fine...
